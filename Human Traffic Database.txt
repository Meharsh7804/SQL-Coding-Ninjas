Problem statement :-
Table: Stadium
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| visit_date    | date    |
| people        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
visit_date is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the visit date and visit id to the stadium with the number of people during the visit.
No two rows will have the same visit_date, and as the id increases, the dates increase as well.

Write an SQL query to display the records with three or more rows with consecutive id's, and the number of people is greater than or equal to 100 for each.

Return the result table ordered by visit_date in ascending order.

Solution :-
select 
    id,
    visit_date,
    people
from 
(select  
    case when (id=lead1-1 and id=lead2-2) or lead1=0 or lead2=0 then id
    else NULL end as id,
    visit_date,
    people
from 
(select
    id,
    visit_date,
    people,
    coalesce(lead(id) over(order by visit_date),0) as lead1,
    coalesce(lead(id,2) over(order by visit_date),0) as lead2
from Stadium
where people>=100) as k ) as m 
where id is not NULL
