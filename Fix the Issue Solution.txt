Problem statement :-
Table: Sales

 Column Name  	 Data Type  
 sale_id	 INT
 product_name	 VARCHAR
 sale_date	 DATE

sale_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold.
Since table Sales was filled manually in the year 2000, product_name may contain leading and/or trailing white spaces, also they are case-insensitive.

Write an SQL query to report

product_name in lowercase without leading or trailing white spaces. sale_date in the format ('YYYY-MM').
total the number of times the product was sold in this month.
Return the result table ordered by product_name in ascending order. In case of a tie, order it by sale_date in ascending order.

Solution :-
SELECT 
    LOWER(TRIM(product_name)) AS product_name,
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS sale_date,
    COUNT(*) AS total
FROM Sales
GROUP BY 
    LOWER(TRIM(product_name)), 
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY 
    product_name ASC, sale_date ASC;
