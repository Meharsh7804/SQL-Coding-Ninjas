Problem statement :-
Table: Accounts

+----------------+------+
| Column Name    | Type |
+----------------+------+
| account_id     | int  |
| max_income     | int  |
+----------------+------+
account_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about the maximum monthly income for one bank account.


Table: Transactions

+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| transaction_id | int      |
| account_id     | int      |
| type           | ENUM     |
| amount         | int      |
| day            | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
transaction_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about one transaction.
type is ENUM ('Creditor','Debtor') where 'Creditor' means the user deposited money into their account and 'Debtor' means the user withdrew money from their account.
amount is the amount of money depositied/withdrawn during the transaction.

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of all suspicious bank accounts.

A bank account is suspicious if the total income exceeds the max_income for this account for two or more consecutive months. The total income of an account in some month is the sum of all its deposits in that month (i.e., transactions of the type 'Creditor').

Return the result table in ascending order by transaction_id.

Solution :-
WITH CTE AS
(
    SELECT account_id,extract(month from day)as monthh, SUM (amount) as total
    FROM Transactions
    GROUP BY account_id,extract(month from day)
    ORDER BY account_id,extract(month from day)
),
CTE2 AS 
(
    SELECT C.*,A.max_income AS maxx_income,
    CASE
     WHEN A.max_income < C.total THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS SW  
    FROM CTE AS C 
    LEFT JOIN Accounts AS A 
    ON C.account_id=A.account_id
),
CTE3 AS
(
    SELECT *,LEAD(SW) OVER(PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY monthh) FROM CTE2
)
SELECT DISTINCT(account_id) FROM CTE3
WHERE SW=lead;
