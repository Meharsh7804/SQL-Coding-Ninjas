Problem statement :-
Table: Delivery

+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).

If the preferred delivery date of the customer is the same as the order date then the order is called immediate otherwise it's called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has exactly one first order.

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Solution :-
WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT *, 
CASE 
    WHEN order_date=customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 'immediate' ELSE 'scheduled' END AS PREFERANCE
 FROM 
(SELECT * FROM Delivery
WHERE order_date IN (SELECT MIN(order_date) AS order_date FROM Delivery 
GROUP BY customer_id)
ORDER BY customer_id) AS T1
),
CTE2 AS
(
SELECT COUNT(PREFERANCE) AS TOTAL_COUNT FROM CTE
),
CTE3 AS
(
SELECT COUNT(PREFERANCE) AS immediate_COUNT FROM CTE 
WHERE PREFERANCE='immediate'
)
SELECT ROUND((C3.immediate_COUNT*100/C2.TOTAL_COUNT),2) AS immediate_percentage FROM 
CTE3 AS C3,CTE2 AS C2;
