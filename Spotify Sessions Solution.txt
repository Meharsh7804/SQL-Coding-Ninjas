Problem statement :-
Table: Playback

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| session_id  | int  |
| customer_id | int  |
| start_time  | int  |
| end_time    | int  |
+-------------+------+
session_id is the primary key for this table.
customer_id is the ID of the customer watching this session.
The session runs during the inclusive interval between start_time and end_time.
It is guaranteed that start_time <= end_time and that two sessions for the same customer do not intersect.

Table: Ads

 +-------------+------+
 | Column Name | Type |
 +-------------+------+
 | ad_id       | int  |
 | customer_id | int  |
 | timestamp   | int  |
 +-------------+------+
ad_id is the primary key for this table.
Customer_id is the ID of the customer viewing this ad.
Timestamp is the moment of time at which the ad was shown.


Write an SQL query to report all the sessions that did not get shown any ads.

Return the result table in any order.

Solution :-
SELECT session_id
FROM Playback p
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Ads a
    WHERE a.customer_id = p.customer_id
      AND a.timestamp BETWEEN p.start_time AND p.end_time
);
