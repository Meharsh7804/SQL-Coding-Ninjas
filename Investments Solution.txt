Problem statement :-
Write a query to print the sum of all total investment values in 2016 (TIV_2016), to a scale of 2 decimal places, for all policy holders who meet the following criteria:

Have the same TIV_2015 value as one or more other policyholders.
Are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e.: the (latitude, longitude) attribute pairs must be unique).
Input Format:
The insurance table is described as follows:

| Column Name | Type          |
|-------------|---------------|
| PID         | INTEGER(11)   |
| TIV_2015    | NUMERIC(15,2) |
| TIV_2016    | NUMERIC(15,2) |
| LAT         | NUMERIC(5,2)  |
| LON         | NUMERIC(5,2)  |
where PID is the policyholder's policy ID, TIV_2015 is the total investment value in 2015, TIV_2016 is the total investment value in 2016, LAT is the latitude of the policy holder's city, and LON is the longitude of the policy holder's city.

Solution :-
SELECT SUM(tiv_2016) as TIV_2016
FROM Insurance
JOIN 
(SELECT Lat, Lon
FROM Insurance
GROUP BY Lat, Lon
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1) AS base
ON Insurance.Lat = base.Lat AND Insurance.Lon = base.Lon
GROUP BY tiv_2015
