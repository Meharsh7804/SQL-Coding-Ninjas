Problem statement :-
Table: Customers

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id customer.


Write an SQL query to find the missing customer IDs. The missing IDs are ones that are not in the Customers table but are in the range between 1 and the maximum customer_id present in the table.

Notice that the maximum customer_id will not exceed 100.
Return the result table ordered by ids in ascending order.

Solution :-
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT customer_id AS "ids", row_number() over(order by customer_id) as rn 
    from Customers
)
Select rn as ids from CTE where ids != rn
