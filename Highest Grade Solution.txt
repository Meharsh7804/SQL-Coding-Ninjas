Problem statement :-
Table: Enrollments

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| course_id     | int     |
| grade         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(student_id, course_id) is the primary key of this table.

Write a SQL query to find the highest grade with its corresponding course for each student. In case of a tie, you should find the course with the smallest course_id. The output must be sorted by increasing student_id.

Solution :-
with cte as (select*, row_number() over(partition by student_id order by grade desc, course_id) as rnk
from enrollments)
select student_id, course_id, grade
from cte 
where rnk = 1
order by student_id;
