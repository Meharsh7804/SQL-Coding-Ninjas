Problem statement :-
Table: Events

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| business_id   | int     |
| event_type    | varchar |
| occurences    | int     | 
+---------------+---------+
(businessid, eventtype) is the primary key of this table.
Each row in the table logs the info that an event of some type occurred at some business for a number of times.
The average activity for a particular event_type is the average occurences across all companies that have this event.

An active business is a business that has more than one event_type such that their occurences is strictly greater than the average activity for that event.
Write an SQL query to find all active businesses.

Solution :-
with CTE as (SELECT e1.*
FROM Events e1
JOIN
    (SELECTevent_type, AVG(occurences) AS avgg
     FROM Events
     GROUP BY event_type
    ) AS e2 
ON e1.event_type = e2.event_type
WHERE e1.occurences > e2.avgg
AND 
    e1.business_id IN (
        SELECT business_id 
        FROM Events 
        GROUP BY business_id 
        HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
    ))
SELECT cte.business_id
from cte 
GROUP by cte.business_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >=2
