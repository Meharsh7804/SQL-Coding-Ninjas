Problem statement :-
Table: SchoolA

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| student_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a student in school A.
All student_name are distinct.


Table: SchoolB

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| student_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a student in school B.
All student_name are distinct.


Table: SchoolC

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| student_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a student in school C.
All student_name are distinct.


There is a country with three schools, where each student is enrolled in exactly one school. The country is joining a competition and wants to select one student from each school to represent the country such that:

member_A is selected from SchoolA,
member_B is selected from SchoolB,
member_C is selected from SchoolC, and
The selected students' names and IDs are pairwise distinct (i.e. no two students share the same name, and no two students share the same ID).
Write an SQL query to find all the possible triplets representing the country under the given constraints.

Return the result table in any order.

Solution :-
SELECT
    A.student_name AS member_A,
    B.student_name AS member_B,
    C.student_name AS member_C
FROM
    SchoolA A
    JOIN SchoolB B ON A.student_id <> B.student_id
    JOIN SchoolC C ON A.student_id <> C.student_id
                   AND B.student_id <> C.student_id
WHERE
    A.student_name <> B.student_name
    AND A.student_name <> C.student_name
    AND B.student_name <> C.student_name;
