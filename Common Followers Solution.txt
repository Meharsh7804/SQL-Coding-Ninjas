Problem statement :-
Table: Relations

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id     | int  |
| follower_id | int  |
+-------------+------+
(user_id, follower_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID follower_id is following the user with ID user_id.


Write an SQL query to find all the pairs of users with the maximum number of common followers. In other words, if the maximum number of common followers between any two users is maxCommon, then you have to return all pairs of users that have maxCommon common followers.

The result table should contain the pairs user1_id and user2_id where user1_id < user2_id.

Return the result table in any order.

Solution :-
with cte1 as
(select r1.user_id as user1_id,r2.user_id as user2_id,
count(r1.follower_id)as cnt from relations r1 join relations r2 
on r1.follower_id=r2.follower_id and r1.user_id<r2.user_id 
group by r1.user_id,r2.user_id)
select user1_id,user2_id from cte1 where 
cnt=(Select max(cnt) from cte1)
