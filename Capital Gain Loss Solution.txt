Problem statement :-
Table: Stocks
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| stock_name    | varchar |
| operation     | enum    |
| operation_day | int     |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(stock_name, operation_day) is the primary key for this table.
The operation column is an ENUM of type ('Sell', 'Buy')
Each row of this table indicates that the stock which has stock_name had an operation on the day operation_day with the price.
It is guaranteed that each 'Sell' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Buy' operation in a previous day.

Write an SQL query to report the Capital gain/loss for each stock.

The capital gain/loss of a stock is total gain or loss after buying and selling the stock one or many times.
Return the result table in any order.

Solution :-
select stock_name,
sum(case when operation='Sell' then price else -price end) 
as capital_gain_loss from Stocks group by stock_name
