Problem statement :-
Table: Department

 Column Name  	 Data Type  
 id	 	 INT
 revenue	 INT
 month	 	 VARCHAR

The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
The month has values in ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"].

Write an SQL query to reformat the table such that there is a department id column and a revenue column for each month.

The query result format is in the following example: Department table:

 id  	 revenue  	 month  
 1	 8000	 Jan
 2	 9000	 Jan
 3	 10000	 Feb
 1	 7000	 Feb
 1	 6000	 Mar

Solution :-
select id,
sum(case when month = 'Jan' then revenue else null end) as Jan_revenue,
sum(case when month = 'Feb' then revenue else null end) as Feb_revenue,
sum(case when month = 'Mar' then revenue else null end) as Mar_revenue,
sum(case when month = 'Apr' then revenue else null end) as Apr_revenue,
sum(case when month = 'May' then revenue else null end) as May_revenue,
sum(case when month = 'Jun' then revenue else null end) as Jun_revenue,
sum(case when month = 'Jul' then revenue else null end) as Jul_revenue,
sum(case when month = 'Aug' then revenue else null end) as Aug_revenue,
sum(case when month = 'Sep' then revenue else null end) as Sep_revenue,
sum(case when month = 'Oct' then revenue else null end) as Oct_revenue,
sum(case when month = 'Nov' then revenue else null end) as Nov_revenue,
sum(case when month = 'Dec' then revenue else null end) as Dec_revenue
from department
group by id
order by id
